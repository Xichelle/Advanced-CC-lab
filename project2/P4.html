                I remember the fig tree twisting its powerful branches, its leaves stretching out like palms. <br>
                The fine gray hairs on the back of the leaves rub against each other, creating a canarylike texture under the flash light. <br>
                I once wondered if FIG leaves could also be sewed into clothes, <br>
                and I remember reading in the book that the first clothes Adam and Eve put on <br>
                after eating an apple in the Garden of Eden were FIG leaves. <br>
                From then on, I had a very intimate feeling for figs. <br>
                The flowers in the fruit, <br>
                the narrow entrance only for the FIG bee to enter, <br>
                and the soft and fuzzy leaves <br>
                all made me feel a certain intimate connection. <br>
                It's a very Chinese plant, with all the heat and tears inside, fermenting, purifying, <br>
                until it's finally pulled apart to release the softest sweetness<br>
