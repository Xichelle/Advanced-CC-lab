                I saw my grandma rubbed the juice of fig leaves on her ankle to treat the itchy mosquito bites<br>
                She told me she learned this when she lived in the village when she was young.<br>

            When I pick a fig from the tree, I can see its sadness. <br>
            <br>
            Its tears are white and sticky, like a thin stream, flow on my hands.<br>
