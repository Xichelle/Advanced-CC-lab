<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>
    The eye: It is the fountain of wisdom, the dwelling place of the soul<br>
    We lived in darkness and chaos until we opened our eyes for the first time at dawn<br>
    We see the bright morning glow and get to explore the world<br>
    God gives us eyes, soul and knowledge<br>
    We will repay with loyalty, labor and faith<br>
</p>
<p>
    Be careful too.<br>
    The witches would lure human with serpent eyes<br>
