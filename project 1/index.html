<h2>Untitled</h2>
<p>
I have seen a world where people no longer feel joy and pain for life<br>
Work became the meaning of life, <br>
doing the same thing over and over again<br>
Build white graves in paper <br>
and breathe rust-smelling poison by the assembly line, <br>
step by step into the foreseeable tomorrow and beyond<br>
An old man looked up at me and asked: <br>
Young man, Why don't you go to work?<br>
I didn't talk. I just <a href=LAH1.html>looked at him</a><br>
As if my <a href="Eye.html">eyes</a> were a lens that could capture the past, present, and future<br>
