    I have seen a world where people no longer feel joy and pain for life<br>
    Work became the meaning of life, <br>
    doing the same thing over and over again<br>
    Build white graves in paper <br>
    and breathe rust-smelling poison by the assembly line, <br>
    step by step into the foreseeable tomorrow and beyond<br>
    An old man looked up at me and asked: <br>
    "Young man, Why don't you go to work?"<br>
    I didn't talk. I just <a href=LAH1.html>looked at him</a><br>
    As if my <a href="Eye.html">eyes</a> were a lens that could capture the past, present, and future<br>
